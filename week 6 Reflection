•	Why is this week's topic important for teamwork?
This week’s discussion was very important and made me really think about life. We learned to self-reflect on a lot of simple but deep things that might be a compass for my life to come. We learned about how to look past a simple word like “work” and go into a self-reflection on how we reflect on it. 
•	How do plan on contributing to the team, besides completing your tasks?
This will be hard this week as most of my group didn’t attend class this week. I will reach out to them and try to get some feedback that will help them know what they have missed. 
•	How does your experience relate to other experiences you have had?
So far through this semester in this class I have learned not much of what I have already experienced in life. Today changed that for me! I have learned and can relate with my group that we have all had jobs in the past and experiences that has helped us reflect on a few things today.
•	How does your experience relate to other classmates’ experiences?
I can say this today that even though my experiences happened over a cycle of over twice as many years. My classmates can relate to terrible jobs just as much as I can.
•	If this was a religion class, how would you relate this week’s topic to the gospel?
Most of us have grown up in the church and might have not questioned anything so far. But how often have we looked back and asked ourselves what we have learned. What is faith and or the gospel? I can relate all of this to the gospel in a way of reflection.
